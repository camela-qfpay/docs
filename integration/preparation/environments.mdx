The QFPay API is accessible via three main environments: **Production**, **Live Testing**, and **Sandbox**.

Each serves a different purpose and uses a distinct base URL. Be sure to target the appropriate environment when testing or deploying.

## Environment Details

| Environment  | Base URL                            | Notes                                                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Production   | `https://openapi-hk.qfapi.com`      | Actual live payments with real settlement                          |
| Live Testing | `https://test-openapi-hk.qfapi.com` | Real payment flow but may be linked to test accounts (not settled) |
| Sandbox      | `https://openapi-int.qfapi.com`     | For simulating credit card payments without deducting real funds   |

<Warning>
  Transactions conducted in the **Live Testing** environment using test accounts will **not be settled**. Please ensure refunds are triggered immediately for any such tests.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Ensure you use the correct domain when switching between environments. Mixing credentials or endpoints across environments will result in signature or authorisation errors.
