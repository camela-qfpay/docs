Welcome to the official QFPay OpenAPI documentation.

To get started, review the instructions below. This guide will help you integrate QFPay APIs smoothly and securely.

- Code examples in **Python, Java, Node.js, and PHP** are included directly in this documentation.
- You can copy and modify them to suit your integration.

If you'd like to quickly test the payment functions using Postman, we provide a pre-configured collection with a built-in script to generate the signature.\

## Developer Instructions

To use the QFPay OpenAPI, you must first obtain your API credentials, including:

- `app_code`
- `client_key`
- (Optional) `mchid`, if required for your merchant setup

<Note>
  If `mchid` is provided to you by QFPay, you must include it in all API requests (unless explicitly stated otherwise).\
  If `mchid` is **not** provided, do **not** submit it in the request payload.
</Note>

### Credentials and Merchant Structure

- Every merchant receives a unique `app_code` and `client_key`.
- Merchants with multiple store branches are also assigned a `mchid` to distinguish outlets.
- The `mchid` is a hashed string that identifies the specific shop or branch.

### Encoding

Unless otherwise specified, all request and response data is encoded in `UTF-8`.
